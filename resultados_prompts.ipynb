outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge pouring cash into gold property and other assets and hide illicit wealth previously unreported details modi’ handling the called “demonetisation” open window onto the hands role played implementing key policy and how was willing act quickly even when the risks were high while some advocates say the scrapping the banknotes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues millions indians are furious having queue for hours outside banks exchange deposit their old money labourers have also been unpaid and

state uttar pradesh holding election early 2017 that could decide modi’ chances second term office there little time for the hoped for benefits his cash swap outweigh short term pain modi has staked his reputation and popularity the move “ have done all the research and fails then blame ” modi told cabinet meeting nov shortly before the move was announced according three ministers who attended

the nation cautioned that people could face temporary hardship replacement 500 and 000 rupee notes were introduced calling for act collective sacrifice promised steps soften the blow for the nine indians who live the cash economy “biggest boldest step” immediately after the address adhia sent tweet “this the biggest and the boldest step the government for containing black money ” the boast harked back modi’ election vow recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed with the corruption scandals that plagued the last congress government yet office struggled keep his promise over more than year modi commissioned research from officials the finance ministry the central bank and think tanks how advance his fight against black money close aide said demanded answers questions such how quickly india could print new banknotes how distribute them would state banks benefit they received rush new deposits and who would gain from demonetisation the topics were broken prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that cash swap was the offing “ didn’ want let the cat out the bag ” said senior official directly involved “had people got whiff the decision the
